This is my Capstone project 
The Matcha Shop

The website is a e-commerce website

Right now The website is Semi-functional

Some of the buttons on the site are useable and led to other sites that I Create

In these Site was mainly styled with boostrap.

image was added to the image file 

as well there is a css file with some css i have done to some

This is the first project i have done after taking classes on pluarsight.


one of the hardest for me was trying to figure out the drop down for the navbar. 
there was supposed to be a drop down for it but i just switched out becuase i wasnt
able to make it work

the other part that took me a little bit to figure out was how to make my footer
transparent. It took me a minute but i was able to look thou the codes i have and 
found the right ones to change.
